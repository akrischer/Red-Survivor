Red-Survivor
============

I am a part of Mustachio Games creating its flagship title, Red Survivor.

In this repository I've attached snippets of code that I've worked on. I cannot share the entire project, so I've added parts that I've worked on. Red Survivor is being made using Unity 4.5.x with C#. Some code interacts with built-in Unity features, such as extending the MonoBehaviour class and interacting with the Mechanim Animation System. In this cases I will try to give context as to what's going on.
